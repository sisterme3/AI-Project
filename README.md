            Title
            Authors - minimum 2, maximum 3
            200-250 words
                Where did you find this problem?
                Why is this problem significant?  (e.g., if it's a game or puzzle, how is your strategy useful for real-world problems?)
                What algorithm(s) do you plan to apply?
                What special heuristics or algorithmic improvements do you hope to pursue?
            annotated Bibliography, 3+ entries
        If Code:
            post a project on GitHub
            email link, Wednesday, Oct. 31
            must compile
            must have a working UI,
                usable without IDE (except for robotics)
            UI must allow creation of arbitrary instances
            must run for non-trivial instances
        If Proofs / Examples
