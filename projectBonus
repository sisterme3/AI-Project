-Completed all neccessary requirements
Writing Quality (up to 10)

    Clarity
    Thorough background
    Enough information to reproduce the work

-Within our paper, we clearly explain what dominosa is and how it relates to a CSP. We also give a through background on the real
world applications and usage of CSP and also detail our process to ensure that we give enough information for the project to be 
reproduced.

Pretty, intuitive UI (max. 5)

-Although there aren't any flashing graphics, the program is still easily for the user to operate intuitively

Robust on many problem instances (max. 10)
 
- This dominosa solver/game has 11 different boards to solve with 1 demoboard, 3 easy boards, 3 medium boards, 3 hard boards, and 
1 Extra hard board. 

Smarter than casual user (max. 5)
- By using our backtracking search algorithm, we found that our Dominosa solver, with heuristic could solve any problem better than
the casual player.
